When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  This should be the ideal practice when I am collaboratin on a project with others. Another
  scenerio will be when I need to access my work from multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	This allows me to specifically determine when and what to pull and to prevent Git from clustering up my local dev encironment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	We fork GitHub hosted repos onto GitHub hosted repos; we clone GitHub hosted and localBased hosted repos onto a localBased hosted repo, then we branch any repo however we want.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It helps my local copy to be up to date especially on occassions when I may not have access to the internet for a while.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	That's a tough one. Emails and any short messaging services could help. However, they are not optimized for these code collaboration processes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	I would use a separate branch to make changes when I need to experiment with my code, or adding a new feature that I don't want to conflict with my master brnch.
