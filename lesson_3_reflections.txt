When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  This should be the ideal practice when I am collaboratin on a project with others. Another
  scenerio will be when I need to access my work from multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	This allows me to specifically determine when and what to pull and to prevent Git from clustering up my local dev encironment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	We fork GitHub hosted repos onto GitHub hosted repos; we clone GitHub hosted and localBased hosted repos onto a localBased hosted repo, then we branch any repo however we want.
